# 👋 Hi, I’m Vasim 

I'm a fullstack developer with a deep background in architecture and BIM. My journey started with designing buildings and planning cityscapes — now, I build software systems that help engineers and architects work faster, smarter, and better.

Over the years, I’ve discovered my passion lies at the intersection of technical problem-solving and creative design. Whether it’s automating BIM workflows or reverse-engineering obscure APIs, I thrive in complexity and enjoy bringing clarity through code.

## 🚀 What Drives Me

I’m deeply motivated by solving hard problems — especially ones others avoid. From modernizing outdated workflows in the AEC industry to building secure SaaS solutions from scratch, I enjoy pushing the limits of what’s possible with the right tools and the right mindset.

At my core, I believe in:

- **Precision** – inherited from architecture
- **Scalability** – born out of writing production-grade code
- **Purpose** – shaped by a desire to empower others through technology
